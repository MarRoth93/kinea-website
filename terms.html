        in the app or on the website. Your continued use of the Service after the updated Terms become effective means you accept the changes.
    </p>

    <h2 id="eligibility">2. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
        You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction) to use the Service.

    </p>

    <h2 id="ai">5. AI-Generated Outputs</h2>
    <p>
        Some features use AI to generate recommendations, summaries, or insights. AI outputs:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>May be inaccurate, incomplete, or inappropriate for your specific circumstances.</li>
        <li>Are provided for informational purposes only and are not a substitute for professional advice.</li>
        <li>Should be reviewed and applied cautiously, especially if you have injuries or medical conditions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="health">6. Health & Safety Disclaimer</h2>

    </p>
    <h3>6.4 Free Tier Limits and Rewarded Ads</h3>
    <p>
        The Service may limit free-tier usage (for example, the number of AI recommendations). If you choose to watch rewarded ads, you may receive additional usage credits.
        Rewarded ads are provided by third-party ad networks (e.g., Google AdMob) and are subject to their terms and policies.

        To operate the Service, you grant us a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, store, process, reproduce,

    </p>
    <p class="muted">
        If you upload documents (such as PDFs), you represent that you have the right to upload and use them, and that doing so does not violate any laws or third-party rights.

    <h2 id="law">16. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
        These Terms are governed by the laws of <strong>Germany</strong>,
        without regard to conflict of law principles.
